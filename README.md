In May 2018 **David Rhodes** [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-43881389) on the time that it takes people in different parts of the country to earn enough to pay their year's rent. The first week of May marks the point when the average UK worker has paid off their rent - but the story also highlighted regional variation in rent costs, and how renting has become more expensive: 

* A middle income earner in England would work 86 days to rent an average two-bedroom home, five more than in 2011. 
* In Scotland and Wales the number of working days needed to cover their rent fell to 79 and 71 days respectively.

## Methodology

The BBC England Data Unit analysed data for the median rent of two-bed properties in England, Wales and Scotland, gathered by the Valuation Office Agency in England and the governments in Scotland and Wales. There are no comparable figures for Northern Ireland. The total sample size was more than 200,000 private rental agreements.

Median wage data for each local authority area in Great Britain is drawn from the Office for National Statistics.

The number of days it would take a tenant to pay the annual rent on a private two-bed property is calculated by dividing the median annual rent for a property by the median daily net pay for a full-time worker in each local authority area.

Net pay is calculated by taking the gross annual pay for the median worker in each local authority area, accounting for the personal allowance, income tax and national insurance, then dividing the figure by the total number of days the median worker could spend at work. The calculation excludes weekends, eight bank holidays in England and Wales and nine bank holidays in Scotland.
